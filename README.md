# Query MLB Database

Connect to a database and write SQL queries for information on Major League Baseball. Subset and join data tables to answer questions of interest.




Key features:

- PySpark
- Map Reduce
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Time Series Plot
- Pivot Table

Modules used:

- `pyspark`: Python API for Apache Spark
- `numpy`: Python library used for working with arrays
- `pandas`: data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
- `pyspark.sql`: Important classes of Spark SQL and DataFrames.

## Overview and Project Goal

1. Perform a simulation to illustrate the relationship between a sampling distribution and a sample size.
1. Write SQL queries to retrieve MLB players and managers from a RDBMS. Wrangle the data (subletting, splitting, transforming and joining tables) to answer questions of interest.

## Workflow

1. Concepts
2. SQL Queries
3. Data Wrangling
